## **Purpose**

This repo contains the data, full source code, final report, and slides for the MAT 8790 Makeover Monday project.  Briefly, the original graph showed US household distribution by state, broken out into six categories.  The aims of this project were to reproduce the original graph and improve upon it in some way. 

## **Contents**

The repo is organized as follows:

| **Content**                             	| **Description**                                                    	|
|-----------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Makeover Monday Mini-Project - 8790.pdf 	| Assignment description                                             	|
| `data` folder                           	| Source data (.csv and .xlsx)                                       	|
| `code` folder                           	| .R source code files used in the analysis                          	|
| `images` folder                         	| Original graph and output images                                   	|
| `choropleth` folder                     	| All choropleths generated by the `create_choropleth_maps.R` script 	|
| Pham_Prioli_MoM_Report                  	| Two files (raw .Rmd and knitted .pdf) for final report             	|
| Pham_Prioli_MoM_slides                  	| Two files (raw .Rmd and knitted .html) for presentation            	|

## **Code**

The three code files should be run in the following order:

1. `reprod-orig-graph.R`:  this reproduces the original graph and outputs the `incometbl.csv` dataset used in the second step
2. `improve-orig-graph.R`:  this brings in 2016 election data and outputs the `incometbl_vote.csv` dataset used in the third step
3. `create_choropleth_maps.R`:  this generates the choropleths
